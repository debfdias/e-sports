## :dart: About ##
e-sports is a cross platform application to connect players with their best duos and have the best time playing together.
Select your favorite game and start to play with the best ones. Whether you play against them or team up, youâ€™ll be socialising with others in real-time thanks to the in-game chat feature. Keep in mind that, if this is important to you, you want to seek out multi-player online games that also offer an in-game chat option. 
By acknowledging the health benefits of online games, youâ€™ll start to see them in a whole new, much more positive light.
